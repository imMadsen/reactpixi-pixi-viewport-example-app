# pixi/react and pixi-viewport example app

## Hi there!

If you've ever tried using "pixi/react" and "pixi-viewport" together, you might have encountered some challenges. I certainly did! That's why I created this example app to help you navigate through the integration process more smoothly.

  

## What is this?
